I use emacs to edit and reconcile my corporate ledger.

First, I download my bank transactions (from Bank of America) and 
use a "trivial python script":http://sixthdev.versionhost.com/viewvc.cgi/ledger/bofaconvert.py?view=markup
to convert them to ledger format.

I then open two emacs windows (M-x new-frame)...

And edit the bank statement and my ledger side by side.

This is a great setup even if you just want to use ledger-reconcile. However, 
I'm particularly picky about keeping the effective dates filled in, so as I work 
through the bank statement, I just update my ledger by hand, and mark each
entry as cleared (with a * ) as I go.

To check my work, I keep a terminal window open that constantly monitors the 
cleared balance:

<pre> watch ledger --cleared bal asset:checking</pre>

This constant feedback seems to prevent data entry errors on my part, and
the two-window mode lets me move fairly quickly.

Converting the bank data to ledger format turns out to be MUCH nicer than
using a paper statement or even working directly from online banking, because
if you're missing a transaction, you can just cut and paste.
